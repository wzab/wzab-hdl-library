This is a generic, parametrized implementation of the pseudorandom sequence
generator, based on linear feedback shift register, written in VHDL.
This is a behavioral code, however it also gives quite nice results in
synthesis.
The code is published as public domain, in the hope, that it may be useful
for someone...
The first version of the code was published on 20.02.2007 on the usenet alt.sources group.
See https://groups.google.com/g/alt.sources/c/Xyt2HSLcsDI 

This version uses two LFSRs shifted in opposite directions to enable producing
longer random values without performing multibit shifts in a single clock
period (which increased the complexity of the generated HW).

That concept must be yet tested with the statistical tests.
