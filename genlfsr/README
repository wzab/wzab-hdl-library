This is a generic, parametrized implementation of the pseudorandom sequence
generator, based on linear feedback shift register, written in VHDL.
This is a behavioral code, however it also gives quite nice results in
synthesis.
The code is published as public domain, in the hope, that it may be useful
for someone...
The first version of the code was published on 20.02.2007 on the usenet alt.sources group.
