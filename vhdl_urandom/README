These sources implement very simple function for VHDL simulations
on Linux, which returns random bytes from /dev/urandom
as 8-bit unsigned bit vectors.
You can easily modify it to return other random values with
uniform distribution.
The code is PUBLIC DOMAIN.

In this version I've added "impure" to random_byte function
declaration. Otherwise some VHDL simulators complained
about access to the external file.
